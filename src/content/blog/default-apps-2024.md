Most apps have stayed the same since my last year's list. The main thing that changed this year for me is to use a proper task manager app instead of storing todos in Obsidian and needing access to it all the time (I don't have Obsidian on my iPhone). I like Obsidian for note taking, storing permanent notes, or creating drafts, but setting reminders, deadlines, or quickly capturing tasks felt overwhelming. To replace this, and after trying three different apps, I returned to an old app I've used: Things 3.

The list below is mostly a revision from [last year](/blog/default-apps-2023/).
