Last week I found about [Robb Knight's Slash page](https://slashpages.net/) site. It details common top-level URLs with each URL starting with `/url`.

Inspired by this, I created a listing of /slashes URLs that I've added on this blog recently. They can be a found under [`/slash`](/slash/). I already had an `/about`, `/blog`, `/rss`, and `/stats`. The new additions are `/now`, `/links`, `/search` and `/ai`.

In near future, I plan to add a couple more slash pages.
