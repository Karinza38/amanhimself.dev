## What I am doing now?

_Location: New Delhi, India_

- I'm currently work as a documentation person at Expo. Some call me docs steward and some call me docs lead. I think my work mostly resvolves around managing the content side of [docs.expo.dev](https://docs.expo.dev) as well contribute to it, among other hats I wear at my day job.
- I'm 32 years old and living

Where am I working and how am I working (remote)

## What are now pages?

According to [aboutideasnow](https://aboutideasnow.com/about), an
"/about" page is to talk about past stuff including what you have done in your past life. In comparison, a "/now" page is more personal look at what a person is doing right now, and what they care about. A "/now" page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

With mass of information here and there, or looking at social media profiles of a person, it tells you, what I've done but doesn't tell you what I am doing at the moment.

You can find plethora of examples on [aboutideasnow](https://aboutideasnow.com/about). Get inspired and make your own.
