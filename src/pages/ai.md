I have never used AI to generate text in place of my words. None of the posts published on this site ([amanhimself.dev](https://amanhimself.dev)) and other sites were written using an AI tool. Otherwise, where will be the fun in that and will defeat the purpose of having a blog.

Yes, I do usually use Claude.ai and GitHub Copilot for autofilling things, fixing minor inconsistencies, or research &mdash; the way I use a search engine or other tools, for my work and other non-work related stuff.

This page was created in response to [the /ai manifesto](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto). The point of this page is to let you know that nothing claiming to be me is written by an AI.
