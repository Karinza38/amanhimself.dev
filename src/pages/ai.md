I have never used AI to generate text in place of my words. None of the posts published on this site ([amanhimself.dev](https://amanhimself.dev)) and other sites were written using an AI tool. Otherwise, where will be the fun in that.

I usually use Claude.ai and GitHub Copilot for autofilling things, fixing typos, or research &mdash; the way I use a search engine or other tools, for my work and other non-work related stuff.

I do not intend to use AI to cause harm to others. The point of this page is to let you know that nothing claiming to be me is written by an AI.
